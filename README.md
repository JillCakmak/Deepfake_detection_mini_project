Please follow the Notebooks in the structure I created them:

- AI_Project_part1_resnet18 : First Notebook and CNN training with image dataset 
-[Ai_face_alignment] : Try and Error Notebook
- AI_Project_part1_resnet50 : Second Notebook with different pre-trained model  
- AI_Project_part1_Densenet : Third CNN Notebook for image dataset, with new densenet pretrained model 20 Epochs 
- AI_Project_part1_Densenet : Fourth CNN Notebook for image dataset, densenet pretrained model 40 Epochs 

Part 2
- AI_Project_part2 : CNN with fake and real videos, frame extractioin, resnet-18 
- AI_Project_part2_moredata: I extended the video data with more real and fake videos from the web 
- AI_Project_part2_moredata_debug: After the results in the previous notebook I did some trouble shooting as some of my data wasn't uploaded correctly (Includes final analysis of part 2)
